### Hi there, I'm Wil 👋

👦 My name is Willie (he/him), but I prefer to go by Wil or Cjay. 😅  

🏬 I am currently an undergraduate **Computer Science** student at UP Diliman.  

🔭 I'm a front-end web development *enthusiast* with a passion for learning how data can drive business decisions.  

📺 I'm also a big fan of everything Hallyu. Whether it's K-pop or K-drama, I love exploring Korean culture and discovering new artists and shows to enjoy.  

👨🏻‍💻 Python, C, Rust, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Svelte framework  

🇯🇵 Ryujin Nippon ❤️🏐
